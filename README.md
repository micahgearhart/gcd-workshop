Moving from Excel to R  - July 14th  9:00am – 11:00am  Room STSS 131b
The Monday morning session is designed for people that are used to working with spreadsheets in Microsoft Excel.  We will cover the advantages of the R programming language and explore the RStudio desktop interface.   We will learn about the various data types in R, how to import data from other sources and how to do statistical tests that are not possible in Excel.  We will write a function in R, apply it to a large dataset and graph the data using a popular extension package called ggplot2.
 
Introduction to Bioconductor - July 15th  9:00am – 11:00am  Room STSS 131a  (Note Date and Room Change!!!)
Data from genomics experiments can be quite large and unwieldy.  The Tuesday morning session will cover more complicated data structures that are optimized for for working with this type of data.    We will use a special Bioconductor data structure called "GenomicRanges" to compare the locations of genetic variants, ChIP peaks and annotation data downloaded from UCSC.  We will also go over options for visualization such as the Broad Institute’s Integrated Genomics Viewer (IGV). 
 
Integrating RNA-Seq & Annotation - July 16th  9:00am – 12:00pm  Room STSS 131b (Note Date Change!!!)
On Wednesday we will identify differentially expressed genes in a publically available dataset using a generalized linear model approach.  This method easily extends to other quantitative sequencing experiments like ChIP-Seq.  We will use annotation data available at Ensembl and databases such as Wormbase, Flybase and Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI).
